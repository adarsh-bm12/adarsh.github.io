I"â	<p><strong>Content is like a movie. It should display emotion, action, friendship, love, and above all, it should have a story, albeit an interesting one.</strong></p>

<p>Of late, I‚Äôm hearing a lot about the content strategy and its effectiveness in dealing with many content problems (for example, content accuracy, reuse, or visualization). Content strategists often present content strategy as a medicine for all the content related problems. But, does a content strategy, howsoever effective, is ‚Äúthe remedy‚Äù to all the ills ailing the content industry?</p>

<p>Before I talk about my problems with the content strategy and its outcome, let‚Äôs first understand what content strategy is.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-content-strategy">What is content strategy?</h3>
<p>Content strategy is bascially the management of any type of content (technical or non-technical). It stands on following pillars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terget audience</li>
  <li>Content placement</li>
  <li>Content reuse</li>
  <li>Content delivery</li>
  <li>Content tracking</li>
  <li>Ease of navigation</li>
  <li>Ease of search</li>
  <li>Micro-content (same as micro-APIs)</li>
  <li>Content Marketing and lead generation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>All the content strategists base their webinars and articles on the assumption that whatever they are offering is correct, and it‚Äôs precisely what the client wants. Deep down, I always think, where they are getting the data to back their claims. Did they talk to their clients individually, in a town hall, or clients tell them about their needs? What is the source?</p>

<p>Understand it this way, if you are thirsty, would you like to have water or food? More importantly, how do you know that you are thirsty?</p>

<p>You know you are thirsty because your senses talk. Based on the feedback your brain receives, it formulates a strategy to fulfill the need of the body. It‚Äôs on this strategy you act.</p>

<p>Similarly, you need to talk to your clients and prepare a common ground. You‚Äôve to understand what their real requirements are. What all enhancements they want in your content. Only then you can develop a strategy that is your own, based on your work domain.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation without understanding the real requirement is like watering a plant that you somehow planted on a hilltop.</strong></p>
