Living in the time of COVID-19 can be compared to being on a rollercoaster ride, with ups and downs, twists and turns. Businesses and personal and professional lives have been affected everywhere, and we hear of layoffs every day. Everyone is trying to navigate these circumstances without getting too hurt, but is it possible?

> Well, if there's one thing we've learned, it's that the best investments are made during a crisis. So, don't waste a single moment in deciding where you want to put your thoughts and efforts.

## What a technical writer should do?

As a technical writer, the time-tested mantra is to invest in yourself. You've probably heard it a million times before, but I'm here to remind you of it and prepare you for the journey.

Fear can drive us during these times, but it's important to remember that fear can also make us realize that we need to learn and unlearn many things to make ourselves more relevant in the job market. We seek help and blend our research with the advice we receive, and come to the conclusion that we need to learn XYZ technology.

## The story begins with the truth...

Fear can drive us during these times, but it's important to remember that fear can also make us realize that we need to learn and unlearn many things to make ourselves more relevant in the job market. We seek help and blend our research with the advice we receive, and come to the conclusion that we need to learn XYZ technology.

But, the excitement and adrenaline rush of starting to learn something new can quickly fade when reality hits and we find it hard to maintain the intensity. Many of us have been through this situation and have left the new thing we decided to learn.

**Have you ever thought, why?**
It's because fear was driving us instead of a clear goal. Goals should be the driving force, not fear. Goals motivate us, leading to commitment, persistence and ultimately, success.

**What to do?**

To make sure you're on the right track, ask yourself the following questions:

* What do I want to learn and why?
* Will it help me personally or professionally? (I believe that learning something for personal use gives the maximum dividends)
* How much time do I need to learn this new thing?
* How will I measure my learning curve?

When you have the answers to these questions, you're probably ready to take the next step, which is learning.

> For sure shot results, learn in an agile environment.

**What is learning in an agile environment?**

If I may speak in one sentence, it's like having smaller aims to achieve a bigger goal.

To learn in an Agile environment, follow these simple rules:

* Plan how much you can learn about XYZ technology in a week.
* After a week, present your learning to your friends and family.
* Take feedback.
* Next week, start with rule one.

It's important not to plan everything at the beginning, and if your goal is too big and it seems like it will take more than two to three years to achieve, it's more of a wish than a goal. Wishes need a team to fulfill, but remember, you're a lone wolf.

> Fulfilling wishes needs team. Remember, you are a lone wolf.

## My story

As for my story, I've always been a bit unsure about programming, but the lockdown due to COVID-19 changed everything for me. Not only did it give me a new direction in my career, but it also helped me build a new skillset. And that's how this blog came to be.

I learned Jekyll, Amazon's AWS, Github, Liquid, Markdown and Bootstrap (to name a few). I'm not saying I'm an expert in these technologies, but you can see the results of my learning in this blog.

**What all things you can learn?**

As for what you can learn, the possibilities are endless. Don't limit yourself. If you're a technical writer and want to learn Data Science, go for it.

There is some basic stuff though that you can learn as a technical writer:

 - API documentation
 - Software such as MadCap Flare or Framemaker
 - Languages such as HTML5, CSS, Markdown, or XML
 - Image capturing tools such as Snagit
 - MS Visio and other Microsoft Office suite products
   
But don't let that limit you, the world of knowledge is vast and full of exciting opportunities, you never know what you might discover and enjoy, so don't be afraid to explore and have fun with learning!

Any questions, please leave a comment, and I'll answer it to the best of my capabilities.

Take Care!
