## What is Git?

Git is a version control system. Git keeps track of the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what you and your peers have done and may roll back to specific versions if necessary. You can use Git to collaborate among your peers (discuss and update a piece of code or content) and then merge the updates into a single source.

## Should technical writers learn Git?

Organizations now expect technical writers to develop or update their documents using Git and a text editor. All this is part of the "Docs as Code" paradigm, in which you document using the same tools and methods as code.

Git is very easy to learn, and you can master it in no time. Watch this space as I'm going to bring a free Git tutorial. I've developed this tutorial keeping the interests of technical writers in mind.

Thank you so much for reading. See you in the [tutorial](https://gitfortechnicalwriters.beingtechnicalwriter.com).
