So, last weekend, I had the opportunity to see John Wick: Chapter 4. Let me tell you, the movie was mind-blowing - literally. I must have seen at least a dozen heads explode on screen...HAHAHA

Halfway through the movie, I realized that technical writers are like John Wick. Yes, you read it right. Technical writers and John Wick may seem like an odd pair to compare, but when you really think about it, they have a lot in common (sort of). Here are some of the most hilarious and outrageous comparisons I came up with:

## John Wick has a gun, but technical writers have something even more deadly: a keyboard.

Sure, John Wick can take down a whole room full of bad guys with just a handgun, but can he write a technical document that is both informative and engaging? We think not. Technical writers have the power to bore people to death with their writing, which is a deadly weapon in its own right.

## John Wick is known for his incredible fighting skills, while technical writers are known for their incredible ability to sit for hours on end.

Let's face it, technical writing is not the most physically demanding job out there. But just like John Wick can take a beating and keep going, technical writers can sit at a desk for hours on end, typing away until their fingers are numb. It takes a certain kind of endurance to do that day in and day out.

## John Wick is always on the move, while technical writers are always on the hunt for the perfect word.

John Wick may be a man of action, but technical writers are men and women of words. They are always on the hunt for the perfect way to phrase something, the perfect word to convey their meaning. It's a never-ending search, much like John Wick's quest for revenge.

## John Wick is a lone wolf, while technical writers are more like a pack of nerds.

Technical writers are not known for their social skills. They are more likely to be found holed up in their cubicle, surrounded by stacks of manuals and style guides, than out on the town with a group of friends. But that's okay, because they have each other - a pack of nerds, united in their love of technical writing.

## John Wick patiently stalks his targets, while technical writers patiently wait for SMEs to respond to their emails.

Just like John Wick takes his time to carefully stalk his targets and plan his attack, technical writers patiently wait for subject matter experts (SMEs) to respond to their requests for information. It can be a frustrating and time-consuming process, but just like John Wick, technical writers know that sometimes you have to be patient to get the job done right.
Of course, the difference is that John Wick is dealing with life-or-death situations, while technical writers are dealing with the life-or-death situation of a deadline. Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but we all know how stressful it can be when you're waiting on someone else to provide the information you need to complete a project.

## Just like how Chapter 4 had a post-credit scene that left us on the edge of our seats, technical writers also have a knack for keeping readers engaged until the very end. 
While technical writers and John Wick may seem like an unlikely pair to compare, they actually have more in common than you might think. They both require patience, endurance, and a certain level of attention to detail. And who knows, maybe one day John Wick will retire from his life of crime and join the ranks of technical writers around the world. After all, he's already got the skills - he just needs to swap out his guns for a keyboard and his targets for SMEs!

So the next time you're struggling with a technical document or waiting for an SME to respond, just remember: you're not alone. John Wick is out there somewhere, patiently waiting for his next target, and technical writers are out there too, patiently waiting for the information they need to complete their projects. And if all else fails, just channel your inner John Wick and take a deep breath - you got this.
