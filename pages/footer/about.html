<h4> Tell me about your education? </h4>

<p>After graduating from Army School, MHOW (MP), I pursued engineering, as a typical Indian middle-class student would. I understood that this was not what I wanted after receiving my degree in Electronics and Communication (June 2011). I set my foot out in the job market with almost no experience of any programming language, electronics, or communication. It only took a few of rejections for me to consider quitting. I'm sure you understand a graduate's frustration at not being able to find work. In between, I also thought about joining call centers as well. But somehow that plan never materialize. I got a call from NIIT one day out of nowhere (August 2011), and I've never looked back since.</p>

<h4>Engineering and then technical writing, I'm confused? </h4>

<p>So am I :) Jokes apart, I didn't know any programming languages and wasn't particularly skilled in electronics. It was through the grace of my mum that I secured a career in Technical Writing.</p>


<h4>What about your family?</h4>
<p>I'm married and have a child.</p>
